                    <p>I'm Howard, a budding web developer in Melbourne, finishing my degree in Mechatronics Engineering.</p>
                    <p>I currently work for Revel, a startup aiming to connect event hosts with local services. My role as a developer involves mostly front end design and implementation using React with Redux, but I am moving to become more of a full stack developer with NodeJS.</p>
                    <p>I am a third year student studying a Bachelor of Science (Mechatronics major) in the University of Melbourne. With my general focus towards Mechatronics, my electives have been in programming. I am proficient in Python, Java and C, as well as Object Oriented Programming and the Agile Methodology. Recently I have been interested in Machine Learning and developing my knowledge and skills of that topic outside the classroom.</p>
                    <p>I was born in Taichung, Taiwan and moved to Auckland, New Zealand for most of my life. I enjoy video/audio production, gymming and going to dog beaches.&nbsp;</p>
